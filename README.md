# PVB — The Brief

A personal newsletter digest that connects to your Gmail, detects newsletters automatically, summarises each one into a single paragraph using Gemini AI, and presents everything as one clean readable page — auto-generated every Sunday and Wednesday evening. Includes a voice playback toggle between two voices (Californian and Manchester British) via Google Cloud TTS. Built for personal use with Next.js, NextAuth, Gmail API, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and deployed free on Vercel.
